# CourseInsights
A Data-Driven Analysis of Online Course Trends Using Python &amp; Power BI

With the rise of platforms like Coursera, FutureLearn, and OpenUniversity, analyzing vast educational datasets has become crucial for improving user experience and optimizing course offerings. In our project "CourseInsights", we extracted, cleaned, and analyzed over 2000 records across 9 fields, covering course details, ratings, pricing, and enrollments. Using Python (BeautifulSoup) for web scraping, statistical analysis, and Power BI for interactive dashboards, we identified top course categories, pricing trends, duration insights, and enrollment forecasts. Key features include dynamic filters, predictive modeling (regression analysis), and deep-dive comparative studies.
